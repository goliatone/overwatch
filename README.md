# Crime Visualization

## Run Project

To run the project you need Docker installed and available from your terminal.

Build Docker image:

```
$ ./taskfile release:docker
```

Run Docker container:

```
$ ./taskfile release:run
```

The application should be available in the [following url](http://localhost:1981):

```
http://localhost:1981
```

If your docker uses an IP then replace `localhost` by your docker's IP e.g. `http://191.168.99.100:1981`

Once the web server is running you have the main page with the data visualization and this file in the following [url](http://localhost:1981/about).

## Project Structure

The project consists of a backend application and a frontend client created from a template using the [cr](https://github.com/goliatone/core.io-cli) [generator](https://github.com/goliatone/core.io-cli-view-generator) tool that I developed to bootstrap projects quickly.

The backend uses the [core.io](https://coreio.tech/) framework that I also developed and use for my personal projects (NOTE: I just noticed the certs in the website are expired :sad_face:)

Then frontend uses [svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Svelte is [great](https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte) in general but specifically to get something running quickly made the most sense to me.


## Backend

The backend exposes an API with a single endpoint available at:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:1981/api/v1/crime/sacramento?page=1&size=2' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer 0a6fd546-9699-4fc3-8ba6-f878b11f0396'
```
We send an authentication token otherwise we would get a 401 error however the implementation is very naive and not for real world purpose but good for the exercise. 

Our response payload will look something like this:

```json 
{
  "status": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "date": "1/1/06 0:00",
      "timestamp": "2006-01-01T08:00:00.000Z",
      "address": "3108 occidental dr",
      "beat": "3C",
      "grid": 1115,
      "description": "10851(a)vc take veh w/o owner",
      "code": "2404",
      "coordinates": [
        -121.3914158,
        38.55042047
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "date": "1/1/06 0:00",
      "timestamp": "2006-01-01T08:00:00.000Z",
      "address": "2082 expedition way",
      "beat": "5A",
      "grid": 1512,
      "description": "459 pc  burglary residence",
      "code": "2204",
      "coordinates": [
        -121.4901858,
        38.47350069
      ]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "page": "1",
    "size": "2",
    "count": 7584
  }
}
```

The API implements basic pagination. I wanted to implement querying and filtering but did not have enough time.

The application does not use a database, we read all data from a JSON file that the server loads on boot.

## Frontend

## Development 

For local development you need to have Node.js **v9.2.0** or higher installed.

### Backend

The **./backend** directory contains all server related project files.

#### Tests

To run tests you need to start the server first:

```
$ npm start
```

You can then run tests with the command:

```
$ npm test 
```

#### Frontend


### Tasks

This projects ships with a [taskfile](https://medium.com/@adrian_cooney/introducing-the-taskfile-5ddfe7ed83bd) in order to help with some tasks used during development and- in a regular project- deployments. 

```
Tasks:
     1  data:json
     2  dev:certs:create
     3  dev:certs:keychain
     4  dev:clean
     5  dev:docker
     6  dev:frontend
     7  dev:install
     8  dev:run
     9  dev:test
    10  help
    11  release:bundle
    12  release:docker
    13  release:run
```    


### Data

We use a data set provided for this exercise as a Google spreadsheet. In order to make use of the data we export it from the Google Spreadsheets application as a CSV file. 
Once we have the CSV file we want to convert it to a different format, JSON in this case.

<!-- We need to further process our JSON data for our needs  -->

The following are the CSV headers and the inferred meaning of each:

* **cddatetime**: Crime date time `M/D/YY H:MM`
* **address**: Address of reported incident
* **crimedescr**: Normalized description of each incident consisting of a code and a short label
* **latitude**: Latitude
* **longitude**: Longitue
* **district**: Patrol district code
* **beat**: Patrol beat code
* **grid**: Patrol grid code
* **ucr_ncic_code**: *Incident reference code

[City of Sacramento](https://www.cityofsacramento.org/Police/Crime/Data-Extracts/Public-Record-Data-Extracts) police records.
