# Crime Visualization Backend

Uses [Mapbox GL](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/) to render map.
Map code using [svelte-reactive-map-list](https://gitlab.com/brycedorn/svelte-reactive-map-list)

We would use tokens with right scopes and restrict the URL to our application's domain. Tokens would be [generated](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/accounts/#tokens) and rendered by backend so that we can [rotate](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/tokens/) them and maintain a level of control.

MapBox security:

* [Access Tokens](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/)
* [How To Use MapBox Securely](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/how-to-use-mapbox-securely/)
